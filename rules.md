### Duck Size

The canvas size for the Duck SVG is 200x200. You can use viewbox to scale the duck however you would like and you can combine that with the SVG width and height attributes. But, this is done to keep everything as consistent as possible.

### Allowed Colors

Only the below colors are allowed on the ducks. Colors can be added to the list if there is a demand for them, but cannot be removed. All of the items being added to the ducks, must use the below colors.
